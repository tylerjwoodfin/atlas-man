# atlas-man
A CLI to manage Trello and Jira projects.

This project is in very early stages of development. The current version is a proof of concept and may not be fully functional. Please use with caution.

## Overview
`atlas-man` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing tasks and projects in Trello and Jira. It allows you to interact with both platforms directly from your terminal, enabling streamlined project management without needing to open a web browser.

## Features
- List, add, and delete boards, lists, and cards on Trello.
- List, add, update, and delete issues and projects on Jira.
- Separate commands for Trello and Jira, so you can work with only the commands you need.
- Context-aware argument validation, ensuring commands are accurately targeted to Trello or Jira.

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tylerjwoodfin/atlas-man.git
cd atlas-man
```

### Setting up the Environment
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies
`atlas-man` requires some Python dependencies. Install them with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.md
```

## Configuration
Before using `atlas-man`, you need to populate the `config.json` file with your Trello and Jira API keys.

### Trello Configuration
- Visit the [Trello Power-Ups Admin](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin/) page and create a new Power-Up.

```
New Power-Up Name: atlas-man <or anything else>
Workspace: <choose a workspace>
Iframe connector URL: <leave blank>
Email: <your email>
Support Contact: <your email>
Name: <your name>
```

- Once the Power-Up is created, go to the API Keys tab and `Generate a new API Key`.
- Copy the API Key and secret, then paste it into the `config.json` file under the `trello` section.
- Run
```
export TRELLO_API_KEY=<your API key>
export TRELLO_API_SECRET=<your API secret>
```
- Run `python3 -m trello oauth`. Visit the link and enter the verification code to generate an OAuth token and token secret.
- Copy the token and paste it into the `config.json` file under the `trello` section.
- Your config.json should look like this:
```json
{
  "trello": {
    "api_key": "<your API key>",
    "api_secret": "<your API secret>",
    "oauth_token": "<your OAuth token>",
    "oauth_token_secret": "<your OAuth token secret>",
    "alias_ids": { // optional
        "shopping": {
          "board_id": "",
          "list_id": ""
        },
        "todo": {
          "board_id": "",
          "list_id": ""
        }
        // add more aliases as needed
    }
  },
}
```
